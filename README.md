In its basic state, this ruby program shows you the list of audiobooks available for download at the New York Public library, along with their lengths, making it easy to choose a book for your next road trip without the annoyance of finding the perfect book only to realize you won't have time to finish it.

You can pick a book from the list to get more information about that book, including its title, author, publication year, audiobook length, and a summary of the book.

Ultimately, you'll also be able to search different libraries (besides the NYPL), see more books (beyond the first page presented when clicking into "Available Audiobooks"), and sort books by subject or author, or, more important (because the website doesn't let you do this), by length!
