# Audiobook Now
## Find the perfect audiobook for your next road trip.

In its basic state, this ruby program shows you the list of audiobooks available for download at the New York Public library.

You can pick a book from the list to get more information about that book, including its title, author, publication year, audiobook length, and a summary of the book.

In upcoming versions of the program, you'll also be able to search different libraries (besides the NYPL), see more books (beyond the first page presented when clicking into "Available Audiobooks"), and sort books by subject or author, or, more important (because the website doesn't let you do this), by length!

## Installation:

1. Open a terminal and paste in the following command to download the files:
```git clone git@github.com:tuzmusic/audiobook_now_cli.git
```

2. Paste in the following command to open the newly created directory
```cd audiobook_now_cli
```

3. Run the program by pasting in the following command
```ruby bin/audiobook-now
```
